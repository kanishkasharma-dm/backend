# Suppress npm warnings about deprecated flags
# This warning appears when NODE_ENV=production is set
# It's harmless but annoying, so we suppress it here

# Use newer --omit=dev flag instead of deprecated --production
# But Railway sets NODE_ENV=production automatically, so we can't control it
# This file helps suppress the warning
